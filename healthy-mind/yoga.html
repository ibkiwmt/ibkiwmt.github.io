     <h1>Chair Pose</h1>
     <p>Start in Mountain Pose. As you inhale, raise your arms, spread your fingers, 
        and reach up through your fingertips. As you exhale, sit back and down as if 
        sitting into a chair. Shift your weight toward the heels and lengthen up 
        through the spine. As you inhale, lift and lengthen through your arms. 
        As you exhale, sit deeper into the pose.</p>

    <h2>Downward Facing Dog</h2>
     <p>From all fours, walk your hands 6 inches in front of you. Tuck your toes and 
        lift your hips up and back to lengthen your spine. If your hamstrings are tight, 
        keep your knees bent in order to bring your weight back into the legs. Spread your 
        fingers wide, press into your hands, and rotate your arms so that your biceps are 
        facing toward one another. Press your thighs back toward the wall behind you.</p>
        
    <h3>Warrior ll</h3>
     <p>Stand with feet wide, 3â€“4 feet apart. Shift your right heel out so your toes are 
        pointing slightly inward. Turn your left foot out 90 degrees. Line up your left heel 
        with the arch of your right foot. Bend your left knee to a 90-degree angle, keeping 
        the knee in line with the second toe to protect the knee joint. Stretch through your 
        straight back leg and ground down into the back foot. On an inhale, bring arms to a T at 
        shoulder height. Draw your shoulder blades down the back. Spread your fingers and keep palms 
        face down. Gaze over the front fingers. As you exhale, sink deeper into the stretch.</p>
