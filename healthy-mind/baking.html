        tryptophan - an amino acid which helps in production of serotonin. Tryptophan also 
        helps in improving sleep and regulates intake of food. Potassium-rich bananas also 
        contain a good amount of Vitamin B-6 and fiber.<a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1554263/sourdough-banana-bread">Here is recipi</a>!</p>

        Just remember, chocolate should still be consumed in moderation.
